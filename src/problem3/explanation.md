# Problem Analysis & Solutions

## 1. Undefined Variable: `lhsPriority`

**Problem:** The variable `lhsPriority` is not defined in the code.

**Solution:** Use the balance object instead of the undefined variable.

---

## 2. Incorrect Filter Logic

**Problem:** The filter logic is confused and wrong, showing incorrect data and hiding valid data.

**Solution:** 
- Only keep balances with `amount > 0` and valid blockchain (`priority > -99`)
- Fix the filter function: `balancePriority > -99 && balance.amount > 0`

---

## 3. Wrong useMemo Dependencies

**Problem:** `useMemo` has incorrect dependencies - it should be `[balances]` since the logic doesn't use prices.

**Solution:** Update the dependency array to `[balances]`.

---

## 4. Incorrect Parameter Type in getPriority

**Problem:** `getPriority` function uses `any` as parameter type.

**Solution:** Use proper `Blockchain` type instead of `any`.

---

## 5. Inefficient Multiple Calls to getPriority

**Problem:** The `getPriority` function is called multiple times unnecessarily.

**Solution:** Calculate and store the priority value once for each balance during filtering or before sorting by adding a priority property to the balance object.

---

## 6. Missing Sort Case Handling

**Problem:** The sort function only handles two cases (`leftPriority > rightPriority` and `rightPriority > leftPriority`) but doesn't return a value when `leftPriority === rightPriority`.

**Solution:** Add `return 0` for the equal case. Consider adding additional criteria (e.g., sorting by currency or amount) for stable ordering.

---

## 7. Unnecessary formattedBalances Transformation

**Problem:** `formattedBalances` is created by mapping `sortedBalances` to add a formatted property, but it's immediately used in rows with improper type coercion.

**Solution:**
- Calculate formatted directly in rows to avoid intermediate array
- Fix type coercion error by ensuring proper `FormattedWalletBalance` structure

---

## 8. Unsafe toFixed() Usage

**Problem:** `balance.amount.toFixed()` is called without parameters, defaulting to 0 decimal places, which isn't suitable for monetary values.

**Solution:** Use `toFixed(2)` for standard monetary formatting (2 decimal places).

---

## 9. Missing Input Data Validation

**Problem:** No validation for `balances` or `prices` existence:
- If `balances` is undefined/empty, filter and sort will error
- If `prices[balance.currency]` doesn't exist, `usdValue` will be `NaN`

**Solution:**
- Add condition checks for `balances` and `prices` before processing
- Handle missing price data with default values or error handling

---

## 10. Anti-pattern: Using Index as React Key

**Problem:** Using `key={index}` for `WalletRow` components doesn't guarantee uniqueness and stability when the list changes.

**Solution:** Use a unique value from the data as the key (e.g., currency or a combination of properties).

---

## 11. Missing Hook Type Definitions

**Problem:** TypeScript types for `useWalletBalances` and `usePrices` hooks are not defined, leading to implicit `any` types.

**Solution:** Define clear types:
- `useWalletBalances`: `WalletBalance[]`
- `usePrices`: `{ [currency: string]: number }`

---

## 12. Unused 'children' Prop

**Problem:** The `children` prop is retrieved from props but not used in the returned JSX.

**Solution:** Remove `children` from the `Props` interface if not needed.
